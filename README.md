# Upcycled 2045

**"Trash is just a resource waiting for a second chance."**

## About the Game

**Upcycled 2045** is an immersive resource management and crafting simulation game set in a dystopian future where humanity is drowning in its own waste.

The year is 2045. A series of environmental catastrophes—beginning with the "Great Trash Tsunami" of 2030 in Jakarta—has left the world on the brink of collapse. The landfills are full, the oceans are choked, and civilization is crumbling.

You play as **"The Clerk"**, the chosen operator of a revolutionary machine invented by a brilliant but reclusive scientist. Your mission is simple but critical: verify and fabricate "Upcycled Products" from raw waste materials to sell to the public.

Working alongside **"The Dealer"**, you must manage resources, satisfy customer orders, and reduce the global landfill tonnage before it's too late.

## Features

-   **Deep Narrative**: Uncover the history of the world's collapse and the inventor's desperate plan through immersive dialogue and storytelling.
-   **Resource Management**: Balance your supply of raw materials (Cans, Wrap, Cups, Masks, Sacks), Electricity, and Fiberglass to keep the factory running.
-   **Fabrication Mechanics**:
    -   Combine specific materials based on customer requests.
    -   Use the **Texture Generator** to visualize new materials.
    -   Manage **Noise Levels** and **Color Theory** to create the perfect product.
-   **Economic Strategy**:
    -   Sell products to earn money.
    -   Buy upgrades and replenish supplies in the **Shop**.
    -   Manage **Customer Satisfaction** to earn bonuses.
-   **Day/Night Cycle**: Operate within working hours (6:00 AM - 5:00 PM). The landfill refills every morning!
-   **3D Preview**: Inspect your fabricated 3D models (Chairs, Cabinets, Desks) before selling.
